# Stylus AssemblyScript Example â€“ Minimum Even Prime

This fork modifies the original [Stylus AssemblyScript Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-examples) example to demonstrate a minimal Stylus smart contract that returns the smallest even prime number â€” which is always **2**.

## ðŸ§  What Changed

Instead of computing all primes up to a given number `n`, the logic has been simplified to return the only even prime number (2). This showcases a basic AssemblyScript contract in Stylus for educational and testing purposes.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

After building the contract:

```bash
npx stylus test
